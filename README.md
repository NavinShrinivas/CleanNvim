# CleanNvim 

## Requirements : 
- bat
- patched nerdfonts 
- A terminal that can support emojis. Most distros already come with respective font and terminal to support Unicode characters.
- packer (I have written it such that it can install itself, but I don't trust it)
- patience, a lot of it. 

## What is CleanNvim 

It is a minimal Nvim config that gives you everything you would expect from another IDE and more. But it tries doing the same keeping number of plugins and their configs as minimal as possible. 

Obviously with that as the aim CleanNvim can't satisfy all your needs, hence you would have to add small plugins and twea a very minimal amount to get it working as you'd want it! 

CleanNvim also tries to help you with your tweaks with proper documentation along with minimal and sensible code.
